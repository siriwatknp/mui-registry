# Filter Options Component - Context Session

## Project: MUI Registry
**Component Type**: Component  
**Component Name**: filter-options  
**Created**: 2025-08-20

## Mockup Analysis (UX/UI Designer)

### Visual Structure
The mockup shows an "Amenities" filter section with multi-select chip-style options. Key visual elements:

**Layout Structure:**
- Main heading: "Amenities" (large, bold typography)
- Section subheading: "Essentials" (medium gray text)
- Grid layout: 2 rows of filter chips with responsive wrapping
- Action link: "Show more..." in primary blue color

**Interactive Elements:**
- **Selected chips**: "Wifi" and "Dedicated Workspace"
  - Black/dark background with white checkmarks
  - White text labels
  - Rounded pill shape with consistent padding
  
- **Unselected chips**: Multiple options (Washer, Air Conditioner, Kitchen, etc.)
  - White background with gray borders
  - Gray text labels
  - Circular checkbox outline on left side
  - Same rounded pill shape and padding as selected items

**Visual Hierarchy:**
1. Primary heading "Amenities" - establishes context
2. Secondary heading "Essentials" - categorizes options
3. Interactive chip grid - main interaction area
4. "Show more..." link - expansion control

**Spacing & Layout:**
- Consistent horizontal and vertical spacing between chips
- Two-row layout with natural wrapping
- Appropriate padding within chips
- Clear visual separation between sections

### Component Requirements

**Core Functionality:**
- Multi-select checkbox behavior with visual feedback
- Toggle states for each filter option
- "Show more/less" functionality for expanding/collapsing additional options
- Accessible keyboard navigation and screen reader support

**Visual Design:**
- Rounded pill-shaped chips with consistent sizing
- Clear selected/unselected states with proper contrast
- Responsive layout that adapts to container width
- Material UI design system compliance

**Interaction Patterns:**
- Click to toggle selection state
- Keyboard navigation between options
- Visual focus indicators
- Proper ARIA labels and roles for accessibility

**Data Structure:**
- Array of filter options with labels and selection states
- Category grouping (Essentials, potentially more categories)
- Expandable state management for "show more" functionality

## Technical Implementation Plan

**Components Needed:**
- Main FilterOptions container component
- Individual FilterChip component with toggle functionality  
- "Show more" toggle link component
- Typography components for headings

**MUI Components to Use:**
- Chip component as base for filter options
- Box/Stack for layout structure
- Typography for headings and labels
- Button/Link for "Show more" functionality
- Checkbox integration for accessibility

**State Management:**
- Selected filters array state
- Show more/less toggle state
- Filter options data structure

**Accessibility Considerations:**
- Proper ARIA roles and labels
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader announcements for state changes
- Focus management and indicators

## Review Iteration 1

**Critical Issues:**

- Missing "Dedicated Workspace" selected chip - should be selected like "Wifi"
- Inconsistent icon semantics - using different icons may confuse screen readers
- Missing keyboard focus indicators for accessibility
- Show more button lacks context about available items
- Layout doesn't match mockup - should show better row wrapping
- Missing items - only showing 6 initially but mockup shows more
- "Show more" styling incorrect - should be blue text, not default button

**Improvements:**

- Spacing consistency needed between rows
- Chip sizing should be more consistent
- Typography hierarchy needs spacing adjustments
- Color matching for selected state should be darker
- Better responsive wrapping for two-row layout

---

## Review Iteration 2

**Critical Issues:**

- Still missing "Dedicated Workspace" selected chip - this critical item from mockup is not showing as selected
- Layout needs two-row structure - currently single row, mockup shows items wrapping to two rows
- "Show more" should reveal remaining items 7-9 when clicked
- Need proper vertical spacing between rows of chips

**Improvements:**

- Focus indicators look good with focus-visible styling
- Icon consistency improved with checkmarks only for selected state
- Button semantics are correct for screen readers
- "Show more" button styling improved with primary color

---

## Review Iteration 3

**Critical Issues:**

- "Dedicated Workspace" still missing - it's item #7 so hidden behind "Show more", needs to be reordered to appear in first 6 items as shown in mockup

**Improvements:**

- Layout wrapping is now correct with 600px max width
- Chip styling matches mockup well for selected state
- Spacing and typography look accurate
- "Show more" button styling is correct
