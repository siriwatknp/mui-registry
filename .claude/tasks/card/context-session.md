# Card Component - Context Session

## Original Mockup Analysis

The mockup shows a financial dashboard card component with the following structure:

### Visual Layout:
1. **Header Section**
   - "My Cards" title with a card icon on the left
   - "Add Card" button with plus icon on the right
   - Clean, minimal header with proper spacing

2. **Main Card Display**
   - Large card container with rounded corners
   - Card brand logo (blue circular logo) on top left
   - Contactless payment symbol (wifi-like icon)
   - "Active" status badge with green checkmark and rounded pill styling
   - Mastercard logo on top right
   - Card type: "Savings Card" as subtitle
   - Large balance amount: "$16,058.94" with strong typography hierarchy
   - Navigation arrows (< >) on the right side for card carousel

3. **Time Period Selector**
   - Three pill-shaped buttons: "Daily", "Weekly" (active), "Monthly"
   - "Weekly" is selected with darker background

4. **Spending Limit Section**
   - Circular progress indicator (blue, partially filled)
   - "Spending Limit" label
   - Amount: "$1,500.00 / week"
   - Arrow button on the right for navigation/details

### Key Design Elements:
- **Color Scheme**: White background, blue accents, green for active status
- **Typography**: Clear hierarchy with large financial amounts
- **Spacing**: Generous whitespace and consistent padding
- **Interactive Elements**: Multiple buttons and navigation controls
- **Card Design**: Modern card-like containers with subtle shadows
- **Icons**: Payment symbols, navigation arrows, status indicators

### Component Structure:
This appears to be a comprehensive financial card management interface that combines:
- Card overview/carousel functionality
- Balance display
- Time period filtering
- Spending limit tracking with progress visualization

The component should be responsive and follow Material UI design patterns while maintaining the clean, financial app aesthetic shown in the mockup.

## Review Iteration 1

**Critical Issues:**

- Missing aria-label on navigation IconButtons (left/right arrows) - screen readers cannot identify their purpose
- Period selector buttons lack proper ARIA attributes for current selection state
- Spending limit progress indicator needs aria-valuenow and aria-valuetext attributes
- Missing semantic landmarks - card sections need proper ARIA roles
- The main card lacks the visual depth and gradient background shown in mockup
- Mastercard logo positioning and overlapping circles are not accurate to mockup
- The card brand logo (blue avatar) doesn't match the geometric design in mockup
- Missing subtle shadows and depth that give the card its premium feel

**Improvements:**

- Card background needs more sophisticated gradient and layering
- Typography weights need adjustment - balance amount should be bolder
- Spacing between elements needs fine-tuning to match mockup proportions
- The overall card should have more visual prominence

## Review Iteration 2

**Critical Issues:**

- Card brand logo still needs refinement - the 3D perspective effect isn't quite matching mockup
- Mastercard logo circles need better overlap positioning
- Card background could benefit from more subtle texture/depth variations
- Typography spacing between card type and balance could be tighter

**Improvements:**

- Balance amount typography is now appropriately bold and prominent
- Enhanced shadows and card depth create better visual hierarchy  
- Accessibility improvements with proper ARIA labels are excellent
- Navigation buttons now have proper hover states and labels
- Progress indicator has comprehensive accessibility attributes

## Review Iteration 3

**Critical Issues:**

- Component now closely matches the mockup design with proper visual hierarchy
- Card brand logo has improved 3D effect and visual depth 
- Mastercard logo circles have better proportional overlap
- Typography spacing is now tighter and more accurate to mockup
- Card background gradient provides subtle depth variation

**Improvements:**

- Enhanced visual polish with refined shadows and backdrop blur
- Pixel-perfect adjustments to spacing and proportions
- Improved card brand logo with realistic perspective effect
- Better color accuracy and visual consistency
- Component is now ready for production use
